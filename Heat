00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,968
Check, charge or cash?

3
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,219
Cash.

4
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,015
Make it out to...

5
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:47,059
Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

6
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,061
$788.30.

7
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,432
Taking me to breakfast?

8
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,434
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

9
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,145
Hey, Vincent.

10
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:47,813
Where are my barrettes?

11
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,107
I saw them on the kitchen table.

12
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,692
I already checked.

13
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:53,277
Coffee?

14
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,537
No school today?

15
00:05:54,663 --> 00:05:57,832
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

16
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,626
Try under the sofa cushions.

17
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:05,548
He's already half an hour late.

18
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:09,302
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:10,845
I'll make coffee.

20
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,264
Out of time.

21
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:27,570
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

22
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,323
Wear the blue ones.

23
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,410
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

24
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:36,329
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

25
00:06:36,454 --> 00:06:37,831
What do you want me to do?

26
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,082
Find them!

27
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,127
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

28
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,045
Daddy's going to be here.

29
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,338
I won't be ready!

30
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:47,048
- I can't be late.
- You won't.

31
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,800
I will be late!

32
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:51,970
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

33
00:06:52,095 --> 00:06:54,681
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

34
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,893
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

35
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,856
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

36
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,952
Give me another refill.

37
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:28,965
What's your name?

38
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,300
Waingro.

39
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,444
You're Michael?

40
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,709
You guys always work together?

41
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:57,836
All the time.

42
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,546
Real tight crew?

43
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:00,839
Real tight.

44
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:05,386
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

45
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:08,180
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

46
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,109
How's he doing?

47
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,610
Hundred percent.

48
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:23,994
Right on schedule.

49
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,496
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

50
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:30,166
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

51
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:31,376
Okay.

52
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:57,068
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

53
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:58,820
Get set.

54
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,030
I am.

55
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:10,790
Here we go.

56
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,236
211!

57
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:14,029
We're being held up!

58
00:10:20,035 --> 00:10:23,372
<i>- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.</i>

59
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,540
<i>Three minutes.</i>

60
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:27,167
Clear!

61
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,076
Eighty seconds left!

62
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,621
Get back! Get back!

63
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,623
Get back!

64
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:44,837
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

65
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,089
Cool it!

66
00:11:58,351 --> 00:11:59,477
I got it.

67
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,145
Got it.

68
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:06,192
You had to fuck with me.

69
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,319
Want to fuck with me?

70
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,439
What are you doing? What did he do?

71
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,024
He was making a move.

72
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:47,951
Dumb motherfucker.

73
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,150
I heard them.

74
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:44,841
$1.6 million...

75
00:13:45,801 --> 00:13:48,428
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

76
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:50,555
Here's $150,000 front money.

77
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:53,558
Get you the rest in two, three days.

78
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,269
Who owned these?

79
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,234
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

80
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,361
Roger Van Zant.

81
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,279
Owns banks in the Caymans...

82
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:10,283
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

83
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:11,618
So?

84
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,713
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

85
00:14:13,838 --> 00:14:15,006
He's insured.

86
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,051
That's the point. He collects
100% from the insurance.

87
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:21,804
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

88
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,975
for 60% of their value.
Makes 40% on top of the 100%.

89
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:31,063
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

90
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:32,982
Try it on.

91
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,067
Kelso called.

92
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,277
About what?

93
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,322
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

94
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,824
I don't need his score. I got my own.

95
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,327
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

96
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:46,078
9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

97
00:14:46,203 --> 00:14:47,496
What happened?

98
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,166
Don't ask.

99
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,619
Find the ambulance?

100
00:15:26,744 --> 00:15:29,914
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

101
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:33,876
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

102
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,549
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

103
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,221
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

104
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:48,349
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

105
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,059
You taking this one?

106
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,478
Or does it stay in Division?

107
00:15:53,697 --> 00:15:57,158
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

108
00:15:57,283 --> 00:15:59,160
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

109
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,287
We got three motorists.

110
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:03,832
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

111
00:16:03,957 --> 00:16:06,501
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

112
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:09,504
Did he ID anybody?

113
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:12,090
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

114
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:16,052
What about them?

115
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:20,056
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

116
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,307
Smart.

117
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,518
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

118
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:26,438
Now, I figure this guy...

119
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:29,607
went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

120
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:31,526
From here...

121
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,069
bang, bang...

122
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:34,654
bang, bang, bang.

123
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,114
This side.

124
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:40,994
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

125
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:44,497
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

126
00:16:44,622 --> 00:16:45,790
Probably executed.

127
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:50,503
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

128
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,380
They ignored the loose cash.

129
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:55,300
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

130
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:58,219
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

131
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:01,222
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

132
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:03,975
escaped in under three minutes.

133
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:06,936
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

134
00:17:07,103 --> 00:17:08,313
Two freeways...

135
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:09,981
within a quarter of a mile.

136
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,316
Traffic video camera?

137
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,777
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

138
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,403
You recognize the M. O?

139
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:16,696
M. O...

140
00:17:16,946 --> 00:17:18,323
is that they're good.

141
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:22,911
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

142
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:24,371
they didn't hesitate.

143
00:17:24,496 --> 00:17:28,416
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

144
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,502
Why leave a living witness?

145
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:33,680
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock-and-roll.

146
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,352
The shape charge.

147
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:42,398
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

148
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:44,692
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

149
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:48,153
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

150
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:51,907
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

151
00:17:52,032 --> 00:17:54,868
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

152
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:59,832
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

153
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,334
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

154
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,919
Hang in with Forensics.

155
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,755
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

156
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,758
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

157
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:14,054
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

158
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:23,689
Anyone want some pie?

159
00:18:33,365 --> 00:18:34,908
Gotta go to the john.

160
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:09,568
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

161
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:26,302
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

162
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:29,681
to make up for his full end...

163
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,477
'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

164
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,434
Hold it!

165
00:21:54,501 --> 00:21:55,711
Where's the rest?

166
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:58,630
We're late. You look too good to go out.

167
00:21:59,005 --> 00:22:00,882
I'll just jump you right here.

168
00:22:04,428 --> 00:22:07,055
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

169
00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:10,392
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

170
00:22:10,517 --> 00:22:11,560
Come on.

171
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,353
You gotta be kidding me.

172
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,189
Honey...

173
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:21,028
it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

174
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:22,320
Let's go.

175
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:23,780
Get your coat.

176
00:22:25,782 --> 00:22:28,869
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

177
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:30,370
What does that mean?

178
00:22:30,704 --> 00:22:34,717
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

179
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:37,011
because I married a gambling junkie.

180
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,346
Get in the fucking car.

181
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,808
What am I doing in here?

182
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,351
You're not!

183
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:47,146
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

184
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:48,856
in the kitchen on your way out!

185
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:52,818
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

186
00:22:54,987 --> 00:22:56,697
Don't even think about...

187
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:24,100
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

188
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,894
Albert Torena call Vincent?

189
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:29,313
No.

190
00:23:29,438 --> 00:23:30,856
Report came in.

191
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:34,151
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.</i>

192
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,362
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

193
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:38,072
Arizona, New Mexico.

194
00:23:38,406 --> 00:23:40,157
Too common to trace a sale.

195
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:42,118
That's wonderful.

196
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,347
You all right?

197
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:06,100
What happened? Where have you been?

198
00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:07,768
Work.

199
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:10,813
Lauren's dad show up?

200
00:24:12,565 --> 00:24:13,608
Didn't call...

201
00:24:13,742 --> 00:24:16,536
didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

202
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:21,791
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

203
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:25,545
I don't know.

204
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:28,006
Fucking jerk.

205
00:24:29,758 --> 00:24:30,967
Is she okay?

206
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,137
She's been in her room all day.

207
00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:36,973
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

208
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,059
I made dinner...

209
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,436
for us, four hours ago.

210
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:46,191
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

211
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:47,650
you withdraw.

212
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:52,238
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

213
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,741
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

214
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:56,326
I'm sorry...

215
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:58,495
if the goddamn...

216
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:00,497
chicken...

217
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,916
got overcooked.

218
00:25:59,654 --> 00:26:00,780
Coffee, sir?

219
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:01,990
Please.

220
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:09,330
Will you pass the cream?

221
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,043
Thanks.

222
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,377
What'd you get?

223
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:16,629
What?

224
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,090
What are you reading?

225
00:26:24,846 --> 00:26:26,264
Book about metals.

226
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,936
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

227
00:26:34,314 --> 00:26:35,982
What kind of work do you do?

228
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:42,405
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

229
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,578
I've seen you in the store.

230
00:26:48,703 --> 00:26:49,954
What store?

231
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:52,373
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

232
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:56,795
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

233
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,671
I'm sorry I bothered you.

234
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:12,185
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

235
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:15,355
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

236
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:17,023
My name's Neil.

237
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:23,530
I'm Eady.

238
00:27:26,408 --> 00:27:27,992
You like working there?

239
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:30,829
Sure.

240
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:35,217
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

241
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:36,510
What area?

242
00:27:37,052 --> 00:27:38,512
Graphic design.

243
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:42,474
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

244
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:46,061
the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

245
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,855
Who do you do that for?

246
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,359
A restaurant.

247
00:27:52,901 --> 00:27:54,862
I did their menus, and...

248
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:59,700
a small record label.

249
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:01,910
CDs.

250
00:28:02,453 --> 00:28:04,204
I've done two so far.

251
00:28:06,582 --> 00:28:08,250
You go to school for that?

252
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:09,835
Yeah.

253
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,254
I went to Parsons.

254
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:13,589
Where's that?

255
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,048
New York City.

256
00:28:15,883 --> 00:28:17,468
How long you been here?

257
00:28:18,594 --> 00:28:19,928
About a year.

258
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:22,056
Like it?

259
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:26,727
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

260
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:36,111
Live in this neighborhood?

261
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:38,989
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

262
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,368
It's a little house I rent.

263
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:47,081
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

264
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:49,875
What about you?

265
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,251
I live up here.

266
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,836
That's very funny.

267
00:28:57,174 --> 00:28:59,468
Where's your family from originally?

268
00:29:02,012 --> 00:29:03,764
They're Scotch-Irish.

269
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,767
They emigrated to Appalachia...

270
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,936
in the late 1700s.

271
00:29:11,647 --> 00:29:13,107
Where are you from?

272
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:15,159
The Bay area.

273
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:17,995
Your folks there?

274
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:23,543
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

275
00:29:23,668 --> 00:29:25,211
I don't know where he is.

276
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:26,963
Got a brother somewhere.

277
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,804
You have a tight family. I can tell.

278
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,181
Right?

279
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,683
You're right.

280
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:50,153
City of lights.

281
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:55,116
In Fiji, they have...

282
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:58,911
iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

283
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:02,331
That's what it looks like out there.

284
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,876
You been there?

285
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,171
No, I'm going there someday.

286
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:18,598
You travel a lot?

287
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,602
Yeah.

288
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,729
Traveling make you lonely?

289
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:31,819
I'm alone. I am not...

290
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,571
lonely.

291
00:30:33,946 --> 00:30:34,989
You?

292
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:37,992
Real lonely.

293
00:32:43,052 --> 00:32:44,220
Albert!

294
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:48,057
Shit!

295
00:32:49,975 --> 00:32:52,645
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

296
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,897
You were supposed to get back to me.

297
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:56,816
Where the fuck you been?

298
00:32:57,858 --> 00:32:59,401
I couldn't break free.

299
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,529
Let's violate his ass right now.

300
00:33:01,737 --> 00:33:03,239
I do for you...

301
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:05,866
you don't do for me, is that it?

302
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:10,996
Vincent, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

303
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,499
That's got nothing to do with me.

304
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:18,337
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

305
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,839
You bullshit.

306
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:22,466
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

307
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:25,136
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

308
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:28,139
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

309
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:31,892
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

310
00:33:32,017 --> 00:33:33,561
You fall in love?

311
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,730
Did you fall in love...

312
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,649
and went off somewhere?

313
00:33:38,774 --> 00:33:40,985
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

314
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,530
Give me all you got!

315
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,574
Give me all you got!

316
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:50,661
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

317
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:52,371
I heard Richard?

318
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:54,790
He's going to talk to you.

319
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:58,169
He's gonna meet you tonight.

320
00:33:58,294 --> 00:33:59,795
He's not here, is he?

321
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,338
No, he'll meet you tonight.

322
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:02,965
What happened to now?

323
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:07,011
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

324
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:08,179
Bullshit.

325
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:10,431
I swear. He said no...

326
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,683
'cause he in Phoenix.

327
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,111
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

328
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,489
<i>He'll be rising</i>

329
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,950
<i>He'll probably leave a note</i>

330
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,869
<i>Right on the door</i>

331
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,121
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

332
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,460
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

333
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:32,712
At 2:00 a.m.

334
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:33,880
Be there.

335
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,590
You be there, too.

336
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,551
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

337
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:41,513
I got things to do, I got places to be.

338
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:43,932
Be there.

339
00:34:50,063 --> 00:34:52,232
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

340
00:34:56,486 --> 00:34:57,612
What is it?

341
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,615
It's a bank.

342
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,536
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

343
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:06,704
to cover Friday payroll checks.

344
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,999
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

345
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:11,626
On the prowl or strong?

346
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:12,836
Strong. Through the door.

347
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,045
How many guys?

348
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,924
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

349
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,511
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

350
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,972
Sounds like a cowboy score.

351
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,725
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

352
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,854
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

353
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,981
Two Telco and a cellular.

354
00:35:35,024 --> 00:35:37,694
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

355
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,654
the night before...

356
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,197
you cut in...

357
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,992
and trick out the alarm system computer...

358
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,452
to turn itself...

359
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,662
and the video recorders off...

360
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:49,998
20 minutes before you enter.

361
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,500
Architectural, electrical plans?

362
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,760
I got that.

363
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:56,805
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

364
00:35:58,223 --> 00:35:59,683
What's the estimate?

365
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,230
$12.1, $12.2 million.

366
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:09,359
You're on.

367
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,737
Congratulations.

368
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:16,074
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

369
00:36:16,283 --> 00:36:18,577
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

370
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:21,747
My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company...

371
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:23,791
take the bonds back from us...

372
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:27,419
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40%.</i>

373
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:32,090
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

374
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,718
Sure, you got a deal.

375
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:38,847
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

376
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:42,184
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

377
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,644
Yeah, okay.

378
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:45,938
Nice talking to you.

379
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,649
You gonna deal with these guys?

380
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,610
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

381
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,154
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

382
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,491
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

383
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:05,374
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

384
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:08,710
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

385
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,462
How'd you get this information?

386
00:37:10,712 --> 00:37:11,964
Just comes to you.

387
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:14,508
This stuff just flies through the air.

388
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:18,220
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

389
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:19,930
I know how to grab it.

390
00:37:25,853 --> 00:37:27,479
Okay, here we go.

391
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:29,481
$13.9 million.

392
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,579
- I bought it.
- Good.

393
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:36,497
What did I tell you?

394
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:41,377
Here.

395
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:45,423
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

396
00:37:46,674 --> 00:37:47,800
How is he?

397
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:49,677
He's a businessman.

398
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,133
Chris is at my place.

399
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:33,721
What's wrong?

400
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:35,890
Husband-and-wife stuff.

401
00:38:36,557 --> 00:38:38,226
I'll let him sleep it off.

402
00:38:52,615 --> 00:38:54,075
What happened to you?

403
00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:00,331
When will you get some furniture?

404
00:39:00,456 --> 00:39:02,125
When I get around to it.

405
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:06,712
Charlene's gonna leave me.

406
00:39:09,132 --> 00:39:10,174
Why?

407
00:39:13,302 --> 00:39:15,397
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

408
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,483
With everything we've been doing?

409
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:22,237
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

410
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:25,115
When you gonna get an old lady?

411
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:26,908
When I get around to it.

412
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,413
You got something else on the side?

413
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,291
Nothing regular.

414
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,419
She got something else on the side?

415
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:38,837
- No.
- You sure?

416
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,465
Yeah, I'm sure.

417
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:45,635
I don't know what you're doing.

418
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:51,224
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

419
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:54,811
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

420
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,566
"that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

421
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,151
Remember that?

422
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,952
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

423
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,385
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

424
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,472
then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

425
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:32,057
Bank? What bank?

426
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:35,310
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

427
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,312
That goes, too. Then the bank.

428
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,859
Want some breakfast?

429
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,701
Are you okay?

430
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,537
Yeah, sugar.

431
00:41:01,053 --> 00:41:02,221
For real.

432
00:41:02,346 --> 00:41:03,472
I'll do good.

433
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:05,141
I'll see you later.

434
00:41:21,073 --> 00:41:22,408
You Solenko?

435
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:23,909
I'm Don Breedan.

436
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:28,289
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

437
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:30,624
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

438
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:32,418
I'm a great grill man.

439
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,961
Good. Good for you.

440
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:38,132
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

441
00:41:38,257 --> 00:41:41,677
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

442
00:41:41,802 --> 00:41:43,639
I'll violate you back fast.

443
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:46,605
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

444
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:50,942
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

445
00:41:57,324 --> 00:41:59,117
What are you waiting for?

446
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:20,597
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

447
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:22,224
Roger Van Zant.

448
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:23,475
<i>Please hold.</i>

449
00:42:27,229 --> 00:42:29,105
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

450
00:42:29,689 --> 00:42:31,483
I'm supposed to collect something.

451
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,495
Someone will call you back
from another line.

452
00:42:36,038 --> 00:42:38,874
818-133-6089.

453
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,404
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

454
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,614
Just send one man, alone.

455
00:43:36,474 --> 00:43:38,392
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

456
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:41,353
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

457
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,689
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

458
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:44,982
He's nobody, Neil.

459
00:43:45,107 --> 00:43:48,569
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

460
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,488
Chris will make up.

461
00:43:50,613 --> 00:43:53,240
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

462
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,287
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

463
00:43:58,412 --> 00:44:02,374
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

464
00:44:02,625 --> 00:44:04,752
on my own, anywhere you want.

465
00:44:04,919 --> 00:44:06,587
Dominick will go with you.

466
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:09,089
And my word counts. But right now...

467
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:11,759
you will give him the chance.

468
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,607
Clean up. Go home.

469
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:20,610
Clean up. Go home!

470
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:07,991
Give me all your money.

471
00:45:08,116 --> 00:45:10,118
You'll get smoked with that shit.

472
00:45:10,243 --> 00:45:11,411
Won't be you.

473
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:16,666
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

474
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:49,073
Vincent, hey, man.

475
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,588
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

476
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,215
It's all right.

477
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,343
What have you got for me?

478
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:04,097
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

479
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:08,310
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

480
00:46:08,477 --> 00:46:11,688
if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

481
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:14,942
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

482
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:18,570
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

483
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,448
I'm a good citizen.

484
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:23,116
I'm Donald Duck.

485
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,285
You got something to tell me?

486
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,705
Check this out, cuz.

487
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:32,918
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

488
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,630
that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

489
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:39,091
Hanna is straight up.

490
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:42,177
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

491
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,596
And you know because I say so...

492
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:48,016
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

493
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,226
Fuck you.

494
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,602
You understand?

495
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,855
I can get killed for telling you this.

496
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,190
You can get killed walking your doggie!

497
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:56,608
All right, man...

498
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,570
there was a cat I was locked up with.

499
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:04,074
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

500
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:08,120
And so?

501
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,206
He's a big fiend for action.

502
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:14,960
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

503
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:18,463
he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

504
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:21,341
and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

505
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,427
Right then and there I know...

506
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,638
this cat's got something going down.

507
00:47:34,238 --> 00:47:35,948
Pretty fucking great.

508
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,911
Albert, what's wrong with you?

509
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:44,123
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

510
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:47,251
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

511
00:47:47,376 --> 00:47:48,419
That's right.

512
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:50,004
Well, I am...

513
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:51,881
over-fucking-whelmed.

514
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:54,800
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

515
00:47:55,218 --> 00:47:57,553
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

516
00:47:58,471 --> 00:47:59,805
Is he kidding me?

517
00:48:01,224 --> 00:48:02,266
I'm telling you:

518
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:03,935
This Slick is no joke.

519
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,895
He's double time.

520
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,230
Say what?

521
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,899
"Slick." What does that mean?

522
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:12,485
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

523
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:15,738
Tell me about him.

524
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,826
About 6 feet tall...

525
00:48:20,117 --> 00:48:22,078
lots of jailhouse tats.

526
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:24,330
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

527
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:28,334
What's his name?

528
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:30,545
Cheritto.

529
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:33,422
Michael Cheritto.

530
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,846
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

531
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:42,515
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.</i>

532
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:45,309
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.</i>

533
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:46,602
Three years in Marion.

534
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:49,981
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

535
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:51,357
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

536
00:48:51,482 --> 00:48:53,401
Who do I have there now?

537
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:56,237
<i>- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...</i>

538
00:48:56,362 --> 00:49:00,241
I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

539
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:02,535
We never close. Open every day.

540
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:04,579
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

541
00:49:04,704 --> 00:49:06,914
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...</i>

542
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:09,500
<i>I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.</i>

543
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,920
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

544
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:15,891
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

545
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:13,573
Put your hands where I can see them.

546
00:50:13,823 --> 00:50:15,992
Put your hands where I can see them.

547
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,245
I tell you what to do.

548
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:20,080
I tell you how to do it.

549
00:50:20,914 --> 00:50:24,334
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

550
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:28,421
take the package and throw it in here.

551
00:50:46,314 --> 00:50:47,440
Behind you.

552
00:50:47,566 --> 00:50:48,775
<i>On the right.</i>

553
00:52:08,113 --> 00:52:09,532
Roger Van Zant.

554
00:52:10,157 --> 00:52:11,283
Who's this?

555
00:52:11,784 --> 00:52:13,244
You know who this is.

556
00:52:14,161 --> 00:52:15,454
Yes, I do.

557
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:17,957
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

558
00:52:18,082 --> 00:52:20,251
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

559
00:52:21,085 --> 00:52:23,295
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

560
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:24,922
What?

561
00:52:25,673 --> 00:52:27,299
Forget the money.

562
00:52:29,844 --> 00:52:33,898
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

563
00:52:34,023 --> 00:52:36,901
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

564
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:39,237
I don't understand.

565
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,991
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

566
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,471
Do you like it?

567
00:53:05,597 --> 00:53:06,973
Look at my ring.

568
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:13,605
Did you know?

569
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:16,649
You are insane.

570
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:23,031
Do you like it?

571
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:25,116
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

572
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:27,202
Don't ask him where he got it.

573
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:38,338
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

574
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:39,881
I don't know.

575
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:44,344
Just like me.

576
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:45,970
I don't know either.

577
00:54:00,568 --> 00:54:01,611
Hello?

578
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,530
It's me.

579
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,325
I was wondering if you'd call.

580
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,286
I've been busy.

581
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,913
Can I see you?

582
00:54:12,372 --> 00:54:14,258
I was afraid that was just...

583
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:16,760
the one night.

584
00:54:17,928 --> 00:54:19,763
Not for me, it wasn't.

585
00:54:22,307 --> 00:54:23,767
Yeah, me neither.

586
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:27,437
Can I fall by?

587
00:54:28,814 --> 00:54:29,898
Yeah.

588
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:32,025
I'll see you in a little bit.

589
00:54:47,165 --> 00:54:48,834
Goddamn convention.

590
00:54:50,127 --> 00:54:52,296
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

591
00:54:52,629 --> 00:54:54,298
We got two transmitters.

592
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,342
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

593
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:58,510
Here we are.

594
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:00,596
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

595
00:55:01,346 --> 00:55:03,307
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

596
00:55:03,432 --> 00:55:06,935
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

597
00:55:09,479 --> 00:55:12,608
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

598
00:55:12,733 --> 00:55:15,027
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

599
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:18,614
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.

600
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,073
Who's the loner?

601
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:24,745
First time we've seen him.

602
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:26,413
We're not on him yet.

603
00:55:28,582 --> 00:55:29,875
Get on it.

604
00:55:47,726 --> 00:55:52,397
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

605
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,495
they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

606
00:56:13,261 --> 00:56:14,887
Baby, time to go.

607
00:56:16,514 --> 00:56:18,891
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

608
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:23,563
You fly.

609
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,022
You're cool.

610
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:36,367
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

611
00:56:37,285 --> 00:56:38,578
I ain't lying.

612
00:56:39,328 --> 00:56:40,788
You're a hot dog.

613
00:56:41,455 --> 00:56:43,249
A regular rodeo rider.

614
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,961
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

615
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:54,260
Now, I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

616
00:56:54,385 --> 00:56:56,596
You don't have a truth-telling style.

617
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,598
What are you talking about?

618
00:56:58,806 --> 00:57:00,892
You don't know what this is.

619
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,901
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

620
00:57:28,669 --> 00:57:30,004
Where have you been?

621
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:33,299
SHU at Pelican Bay.

622
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:35,393
Folsom, B-wing.

623
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:37,896
I am a cowboy...

624
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,607
looking for anything heavy.

625
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,817
Billy said to come see you.

626
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:45,403
That is why I am here.

627
00:57:54,412 --> 00:57:57,082
Why don't you call this guy?

628
00:57:58,166 --> 00:58:00,377
This guy's always putting guys on.

629
00:58:04,506 --> 00:58:05,549
Thank you.

630
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,898
You're perfect for each other.

631
00:58:27,743 --> 00:58:29,620
I knew a guy in grade school.

632
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:32,290
His name was Raoul... whatever.

633
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:35,960
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

634
00:58:36,252 --> 00:58:38,296
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

635
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:41,382
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

636
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:45,553
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

637
00:58:45,678 --> 00:58:47,305
bestial sort of way.

638
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:53,102
Woman.

639
00:58:59,942 --> 00:59:01,777
This better be earth-shattering.

640
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:10,161
This is to Raoul.

641
00:59:12,538 --> 00:59:14,174
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

642
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:58,301
Here's how we found her.

643
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,473
How old?

644
01:00:03,598 --> 01:00:06,643
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

645
01:00:07,477 --> 01:00:08,895
How'd she die?

646
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,399
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

647
01:00:15,318 --> 01:00:16,444
Who's that?

648
01:00:17,028 --> 01:00:18,280
Mother and siblings.

649
01:00:18,405 --> 01:00:20,198
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

650
01:00:20,323 --> 01:00:23,201
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

651
01:00:24,369 --> 01:00:25,495
Let's go.

652
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,334
Nice.

653
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:36,256
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

654
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:39,426
so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

655
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,344
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

656
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:42,679
Not yet.

657
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:45,515
Get off of me!

658
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:49,686
Oh, my God!

659
01:00:54,074 --> 01:00:55,242
Where is she?

660
01:00:55,576 --> 01:00:57,119
Easy, easy, easy.

661
01:01:00,414 --> 01:01:01,874
Please, come on.

662
01:01:04,793 --> 01:01:06,629
It's okay.

663
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:09,381
Where is my baby?

664
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:10,716
Where is she?

665
01:01:11,592 --> 01:01:13,761
I need to know what happened.

666
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,097
I guess the earth shattered.

667
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:01,684
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

668
01:02:03,644 --> 01:02:05,896
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

669
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,648
What was it?

670
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,235
You don't want to know.

671
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,196
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

672
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:16,740
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

673
01:02:17,408 --> 01:02:20,077
You never told me I'd be excluded.

674
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,331
I told you when we hooked up...

675
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:26,667
that you'd have to share me...

676
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:30,504
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

677
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:32,840
And I bought into that sharing...

678
01:02:33,173 --> 01:02:34,767
because I love you.

679
01:02:35,226 --> 01:02:38,938
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

680
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,273
I don't care.

681
01:02:41,482 --> 01:02:44,193
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

682
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,322
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

683
01:02:47,488 --> 01:02:50,491
What I should do is come home and say:

684
01:02:50,992 --> 01:02:54,579
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

685
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,583
"where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

686
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:02,170
"because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

687
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:05,089
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

688
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,261
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

689
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:11,638
Right?

690
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:15,183
Wrong.

691
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:16,434
You know why?

692
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,770
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

693
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:21,105
We fuck and you don't speak.

694
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,358
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

695
01:03:24,025 --> 01:03:25,401
I preserve it...

696
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:28,947
because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

697
01:03:29,447 --> 01:03:30,740
Where I gotta be.

698
01:03:38,122 --> 01:03:39,832
You don't live with me.

699
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:45,046
You live among the remains
of dead people.

700
01:03:48,537 --> 01:03:50,289
You read the terrain.

701
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:54,001
You search for signs of passing...

702
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,712
for the scent of your prey...

703
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:58,797
and then you hunt them down.

704
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:03,135
That's the only thing you're committed to.

705
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,224
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

706
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:18,159
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

707
01:04:37,929 --> 01:04:39,430
Let's go, baby.

708
01:04:42,266 --> 01:04:43,893
I met the manager.

709
01:04:44,352 --> 01:04:45,812
Is that the boss?

710
01:04:46,938 --> 01:04:49,857
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

711
01:04:50,274 --> 01:04:53,694
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

712
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:56,364
Can you do that?

713
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:01,369
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

714
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:09,377
Why're you hanging with me?

715
01:05:11,254 --> 01:05:13,089
Because I'm proud of you.

716
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:20,471
You're proud of me?

717
01:05:25,476 --> 01:05:27,562
Why the hell are you proud of me?

718
01:05:29,147 --> 01:05:30,523
Come on home.

719
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:43,077
What were you doing there?

720
01:05:43,327 --> 01:05:44,745
I was skiing.

721
01:05:44,996 --> 01:05:46,747
I was trying to ski.

722
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:50,510
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

723
01:05:51,344 --> 01:05:53,138
and you meet people.

724
01:05:53,513 --> 01:05:55,056
You try to have a good time.

725
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:56,808
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

726
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,059
Why not?

727
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:00,395
I'm not good at meeting people.

728
01:06:00,854 --> 01:06:02,189
You met me.

729
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,442
That happened without my thinking
about it.

730
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,819
Which is why I probably...

731
01:06:08,487 --> 01:06:10,530
No, it's because you are fine.

732
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,829
Take off with me for a while.

733
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:20,332
Where?

734
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:22,167
New Zealand.

735
01:06:23,502 --> 01:06:24,586
When?

736
01:06:26,296 --> 01:06:28,840
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

737
01:06:29,382 --> 01:06:30,842
But my job...

738
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:33,094
I got money. You don't need money.

739
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,639
You could set up a studio and work there.

740
01:06:36,139 --> 01:06:37,265
I don't know.

741
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,892
What's there to know?

742
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:40,519
Are you married?

743
01:06:42,145 --> 01:06:43,271
What?

744
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:45,440
The last thing I am is married.

745
01:06:45,649 --> 01:06:48,527
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

746
01:06:48,735 --> 01:06:50,403
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:06:51,363 --> 01:06:53,365
someone like you comes along.

748
01:06:56,868 --> 01:06:57,994
You don't know me.

749
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,579
I know enough.

750
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:04,960
Come with me.

751
01:07:14,886 --> 01:07:16,304
What's wrong?

752
01:07:18,098 --> 01:07:20,892
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

753
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:26,898
Yeah.

754
01:07:30,703 --> 01:07:31,704
Good.

755
01:07:56,645 --> 01:07:58,022
Hi, sweetie.

756
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,901
You forget your mom was picking you up?

757
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:04,737
No.

758
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:08,449
So, what's going on?

759
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:12,036
I felt like being alone.

760
01:08:14,997 --> 01:08:16,874
Come on, I'll drive you home.

761
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:14,816
What's happening?

762
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:17,735
Sir.

763
01:09:17,861 --> 01:09:20,488
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:09:20,655 --> 01:09:23,074
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:10:17,795 --> 01:10:19,047
Technique.

766
01:10:38,608 --> 01:10:40,568
Open Sesame. Right there.

767
01:11:38,385 --> 01:11:39,761
There he is.

768
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,000
We walk!

769
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:44,252
I'm there.

770
01:12:44,377 --> 01:12:45,503
We walk! Now!

771
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,852
He's heard it.

772
01:13:10,278 --> 01:13:11,529
Heads up.

773
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:15,324
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

774
01:13:15,449 --> 01:13:17,743
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

775
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:18,995
I see.

776
01:13:22,206 --> 01:13:24,458
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

777
01:13:24,584 --> 01:13:26,919
Both of them are not carrying anything.

778
01:13:36,053 --> 01:13:37,680
<i>- Let them go.
- What do you mean?</i>

779
01:13:37,805 --> 01:13:38,848
<i>We can take them...</i>

780
01:13:38,973 --> 01:13:40,057
On what?

781
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,143
They didn't steal anything yet.

782
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,106
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

783
01:13:47,231 --> 01:13:48,441
No fucking way.

784
01:13:48,566 --> 01:13:51,777
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

785
01:13:51,903 --> 01:13:55,448
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

786
01:13:55,573 --> 01:13:58,326
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:13:58,451 --> 01:14:01,579
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

788
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:48,927
Back to work.

789
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:54,516
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:58,103
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

791
01:14:58,228 --> 01:15:00,695
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

792
01:15:00,903 --> 01:15:04,991
Assume they got our phones, our houses,
that they got us right here, right now...

793
01:15:05,116 --> 01:15:07,577
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:15:08,077 --> 01:15:10,121
How will we buy the bank package?

795
01:15:10,246 --> 01:15:11,747
I'll front that.

796
01:15:11,914 --> 01:15:13,583
What about Van Zant?

797
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:17,837
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:19,380
No, I want my 750.

799
01:15:20,006 --> 01:15:24,218
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

800
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:26,971
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

801
01:15:27,263 --> 01:15:29,640
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:15:29,765 --> 01:15:34,228
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

803
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:41,277
The bank is worth the risk.

804
01:15:41,527 --> 01:15:42,987
I need it, brother.

805
01:15:44,655 --> 01:15:47,825
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

806
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,972
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

807
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:03,225
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

808
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:05,310
On this one, you're on your own.

809
01:16:18,281 --> 01:16:20,325
You figure this is the best thing to do?

810
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:22,661
This is the best thing to do?

811
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:26,957
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

812
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,960
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

813
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,836
You got T-bonds, real estate.

814
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,756
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

815
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,943
For me...

816
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:57,112
the action is the juice.

817
01:16:57,904 --> 01:16:58,905
I'm in.

818
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,954
Yeah, sure.

819
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:07,372
Let's go.

820
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,000
Fuck them, let's do it.

821
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,377
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

822
01:17:29,904 --> 01:17:31,697
Tim, I gotta call you back.

823
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,366
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

824
01:17:34,575 --> 01:17:35,868
Who the fuck are you?

825
01:17:35,993 --> 01:17:37,119
Who am I?

826
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:40,039
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

827
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:43,584
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

828
01:17:45,044 --> 01:17:48,714
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

829
01:17:48,839 --> 01:17:51,759
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

830
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:57,389
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

831
01:17:57,514 --> 01:17:59,600
up from North Carolina three years ago...

832
01:17:59,725 --> 01:18:01,685
or you go to work for us.

833
01:18:02,186 --> 01:18:03,646
Cut and dried.

834
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:05,439
That is it.

835
01:18:05,773 --> 01:18:06,815
Shit.

836
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:09,485
Charlene Shiherlis.

837
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:10,694
Who?

838
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:11,904
Who?

839
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,114
What are you, a fucking owl?

840
01:18:14,281 --> 01:18:18,160
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

841
01:18:18,619 --> 01:18:20,246
You can't tie me to her.

842
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:24,541
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

843
01:18:26,877 --> 01:18:28,504
Why did I get mixed up with her?

844
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:31,715
Because she's got a great ass!

845
01:18:32,883 --> 01:18:35,553
And you got your head all the way up it.

846
01:18:36,554 --> 01:18:37,596
Jesus.

847
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:39,765
Ferocious, aren't I?

848
01:18:40,224 --> 01:18:41,976
When I think of asses...

849
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:43,561
a woman's ass...

850
01:18:44,144 --> 01:18:46,021
something comes out of me.

851
01:18:47,064 --> 01:18:48,065
So?

852
01:18:48,232 --> 01:18:49,817
So, no big thing.

853
01:18:50,609 --> 01:18:52,069
All I want...

854
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:55,072
is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:18:55,322 --> 01:18:57,074
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

856
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:04,456
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

857
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,710
that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:19:07,835 --> 01:19:08,877
Right.

859
01:19:09,086 --> 01:19:11,598
The security systems around here
are a joke.

860
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,272
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

861
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:21,232
No. 2:

862
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:23,526
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 110.</i>

863
01:19:23,735 --> 01:19:24,777
Good.

864
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:26,112
You got it?

865
01:19:26,237 --> 01:19:27,614
Good. Let's go.

866
01:19:50,303 --> 01:19:51,846
They were looking back...

867
01:19:53,348 --> 01:19:54,849
in this direction.

868
01:19:55,683 --> 01:19:57,393
A container facility?

869
01:19:57,518 --> 01:19:59,020
What? Cartage theft?

870
01:19:59,145 --> 01:20:01,856
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

871
01:20:06,027 --> 01:20:08,238
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

872
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:09,697
Refinery only pays by check.

873
01:20:09,822 --> 01:20:11,074
No cash around.

874
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:12,951
Same for the scrap yard.

875
01:20:16,496 --> 01:20:17,789
Stealing hubcaps?

876
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,295
A refinery and a scrap yard.

877
01:20:25,546 --> 01:20:27,382
What the hell is going on?

878
01:20:27,507 --> 01:20:29,592
That's what we are trying to figure out.

879
01:20:30,176 --> 01:20:31,928
We thought we had it.

880
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,013
Thought we had it.

881
01:20:43,731 --> 01:20:45,275
I got an idea...

882
01:20:46,234 --> 01:20:48,152
on what they were looking at.

883
01:20:51,873 --> 01:20:54,084
Want to know what they're looking at?

884
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:58,797
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

885
01:21:00,257 --> 01:21:02,259
This crew is good.

886
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:06,138
Know what they're looking at?

887
01:21:07,097 --> 01:21:08,140
What?

888
01:21:09,558 --> 01:21:10,559
Us.

889
01:21:12,019 --> 01:21:13,520
The LAPD.

890
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:15,939
The police department.

891
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:18,775
We just got made.

892
01:21:26,909 --> 01:21:27,951
Yeah!

893
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:37,586
Okay!

894
01:21:47,346 --> 01:21:49,222
Okay, motherfucker!

895
01:22:09,701 --> 01:22:11,161
Kelso come through?

896
01:22:11,536 --> 01:22:13,997
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

897
01:22:20,045 --> 01:22:21,463
Name is Hanna.

898
01:22:21,797 --> 01:22:23,257
First name, Vincent.

899
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:25,842
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

900
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:27,469
Hanna's all over you.

901
01:22:28,303 --> 01:22:31,023
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

902
01:22:31,148 --> 01:22:33,526
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

903
01:22:33,651 --> 01:22:34,902
He's a hot dog.

904
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:37,446
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

905
01:22:38,072 --> 01:22:39,865
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

906
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:43,536
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

907
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:45,288
He was a fucking maniac.

908
01:22:46,163 --> 01:22:48,374
He was working Narcotics before that.

909
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,252
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

910
01:22:51,377 --> 01:22:53,004
He's why the extra heat.

911
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,466
The vice sergeant...

912
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:00,720
says Hanna likes you...

913
01:23:01,721 --> 01:23:05,141
thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

914
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:07,727
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

915
01:23:10,187 --> 01:23:11,647
Funny as a heart attack.

916
01:23:11,772 --> 01:23:15,276
Three marriages? Do you think
that means he likes staying home?

917
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:18,446
Means he's one of those guys out there...

918
01:23:18,696 --> 01:23:21,365
prowling around all night, dedicated.

919
01:23:23,743 --> 01:23:26,162
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

920
01:23:33,502 --> 01:23:35,087
It's worth the stretch.

921
01:23:36,088 --> 01:23:38,049
This guy can hit or miss.

922
01:23:38,549 --> 01:23:40,176
You can't miss once.

923
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,136
You sure?

924
01:23:43,304 --> 01:23:44,597
I am sure.

925
01:23:50,728 --> 01:23:52,188
Let's go to the garage.

926
01:24:20,558 --> 01:24:21,977
Where are we going?

927
01:24:27,315 --> 01:24:28,775
Where are you going?

928
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:30,151
Out.

929
01:25:28,877 --> 01:25:29,878
What are they on?

930
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:31,212
<i>TAC 9.</i>

931
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:37,052
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.</i>

932
01:25:55,788 --> 01:25:58,499
<i>This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?</i>

933
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:01,126
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

934
01:26:01,251 --> 01:26:04,421
<i>Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

935
01:26:04,546 --> 01:26:06,382
<i>approaching the 110.</i>

936
01:26:07,591 --> 01:26:09,051
Revolving tail?

937
01:26:09,218 --> 01:26:11,929
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

938
01:26:12,054 --> 01:26:15,266
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

939
01:26:16,308 --> 01:26:17,559
Let's go.

940
01:27:07,651 --> 01:27:11,614
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

941
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:13,782
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

942
01:28:20,984 --> 01:28:22,277
How're you doing?

943
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:28,616
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

944
01:28:35,164 --> 01:28:36,457
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

945
01:28:37,208 --> 01:28:38,418
Follow me.

946
01:28:54,267 --> 01:28:56,060
Seven years in Folsom.

947
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:58,646
In the hole for three.

948
01:28:58,813 --> 01:29:00,231
McNeil before that.

949
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,570
McNeil as tough as they say?

950
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:08,781
You looking to become a penologist?

951
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:11,668
You looking to go back?

952
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:16,131
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

953
01:29:16,256 --> 01:29:17,341
That you?

954
01:29:18,467 --> 01:29:20,761
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

955
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:23,221
I worked all kinds.

956
01:29:26,892 --> 01:29:30,812
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

957
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:33,190
I do not.

958
01:29:33,398 --> 01:29:34,441
Right.

959
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:37,778
I am never going back.

960
01:29:39,571 --> 01:29:41,657
Then don't take down scores.

961
01:29:42,950 --> 01:29:44,576
I do what I do best:

962
01:29:44,785 --> 01:29:48,705
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

963
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:54,836
You never wanted a regular-type life?

964
01:29:55,629 --> 01:29:58,298
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

965
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:01,301
Yeah.

966
01:30:03,804 --> 01:30:05,847
This regular-type life like your life?

967
01:30:06,515 --> 01:30:08,475
My life? No, my life...

968
01:30:10,268 --> 01:30:11,937
My life's a disaster zone.

969
01:30:13,814 --> 01:30:16,316
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

970
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:19,945
because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

971
01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:21,113
I got a wife.

972
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:24,074
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

973
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:25,242
My third.

974
01:30:27,452 --> 01:30:31,164
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

975
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:32,582
That's my life.

976
01:30:39,089 --> 01:30:40,841
A guy told me one time:

977
01:30:42,676 --> 01:30:47,055
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

978
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:49,601
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

979
01:30:51,110 --> 01:30:54,280
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

980
01:30:54,697 --> 01:30:57,700
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

981
01:30:59,577 --> 01:31:01,370
That's an interesting point.

982
01:31:02,955 --> 01:31:04,206
Are you a monk?

983
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:06,751
I have a woman.

984
01:31:07,335 --> 01:31:08,794
What do you tell her?

985
01:31:11,255 --> 01:31:12,923
I tell her I'm a salesman.

986
01:31:19,764 --> 01:31:22,767
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

987
01:31:23,809 --> 01:31:25,686
you'll just walk out on her?

988
01:31:27,271 --> 01:31:28,856
Not say good-bye?

989
01:31:29,649 --> 01:31:31,275
That's the discipline.

990
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:33,944
That's pretty vacant.

991
01:31:34,153 --> 01:31:35,780
It is what it is.

992
01:31:35,905 --> 01:31:38,658
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

993
01:31:40,707 --> 01:31:42,668
I don't know how to do anything else.

994
01:31:43,168 --> 01:31:44,586
Neither do I.

995
01:31:47,422 --> 01:31:48,966
I don't want to either.

996
01:31:49,758 --> 01:31:50,926
Neither do I.

997
01:31:58,642 --> 01:32:01,228
You know, I have this recurring dream.

998
01:32:03,146 --> 01:32:06,066
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

999
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:09,736
all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

1000
01:32:09,861 --> 01:32:13,782
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1001
01:32:14,449 --> 01:32:18,370
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1002
01:32:19,663 --> 01:32:22,791
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1003
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:26,586
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1004
01:32:27,379 --> 01:32:29,846
The neighbors reported the smell...

1005
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:32,435
and there they are...

1006
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,270
all just sitting there.

1007
01:32:36,522 --> 01:32:37,690
What do they say?

1008
01:32:39,734 --> 01:32:40,735
Nothing.

1009
01:32:41,193 --> 01:32:42,361
No talk?

1010
01:32:44,572 --> 01:32:46,324
They have nothing to say.

1011
01:32:47,241 --> 01:32:49,201
We just look at each other.

1012
01:32:50,202 --> 01:32:51,829
They look at me...

1013
01:32:52,371 --> 01:32:54,498
and that's it. That's the dream.

1014
01:32:57,376 --> 01:32:59,211
I have one where I'm drowning.

1015
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:03,633
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

1016
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:07,094
Know what that's about?

1017
01:33:08,763 --> 01:33:10,181
Having enough time.

1018
01:33:11,891 --> 01:33:13,059
Enough time...

1019
01:33:13,517 --> 01:33:15,227
to do what you want to do?

1020
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:16,687
That's right.

1021
01:33:19,231 --> 01:33:20,566
You doing it now?

1022
01:33:20,775 --> 01:33:21,984
No, not yet.

1023
01:33:27,615 --> 01:33:29,575
You know, we're sitting here...

1024
01:33:30,951 --> 01:33:33,162
like a couple of regular fellas.

1025
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:36,123
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1026
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:40,586
Now that we've been face to face...

1027
01:33:43,589 --> 01:33:46,217
if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1028
01:33:46,592 --> 01:33:48,052
I won't like it.

1029
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,054
But, I tell you...

1030
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,600
if it's between you...

1031
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:58,604
and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1032
01:33:59,605 --> 01:34:00,773
brother...

1033
01:34:01,273 --> 01:34:03,109
you are going down.

1034
01:34:15,672 --> 01:34:17,966
There's a flip side to that coin.

1035
01:34:20,301 --> 01:34:22,470
What if you do got me boxed in...

1036
01:34:22,929 --> 01:34:24,681
and I gotta put you down?

1037
01:34:25,849 --> 01:34:27,559
Because no matter what...

1038
01:34:28,059 --> 01:34:30,020
you won't get in my way.

1039
01:34:31,354 --> 01:34:33,565
We've been face to face, yeah.

1040
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,570
But I will not hesitate.

1041
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:40,238
Not for a second.

1042
01:34:46,786 --> 01:34:48,246
Maybe that'll happen.

1043
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:52,000
Or...

1044
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:53,668
who knows?

1045
01:34:54,294 --> 01:34:56,629
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1046
01:35:12,538 --> 01:35:14,039
They dumped us.

1047
01:35:15,332 --> 01:35:16,375
What?

1048
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:18,293
They dumped us.

1049
01:35:18,919 --> 01:35:20,128
What do you mean?

1050
01:35:20,254 --> 01:35:21,505
Chris slipped away.

1051
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:23,507
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1052
01:35:23,632 --> 01:35:26,968
so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

1053
01:35:27,343 --> 01:35:29,303
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1054
01:35:29,428 --> 01:35:32,056
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1055
01:35:34,767 --> 01:35:36,519
They dumped all our surveillance?

1056
01:35:36,644 --> 01:35:38,854
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1057
01:35:40,147 --> 01:35:43,359
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1058
01:35:43,484 --> 01:35:44,527
We were on you.

1059
01:35:44,652 --> 01:35:48,531
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1060
01:35:49,282 --> 01:35:51,668
His car's still there. He's gone.

1061
01:35:57,132 --> 01:36:01,636
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1062
01:37:01,487 --> 01:37:02,529
Hear from him?

1063
01:37:03,447 --> 01:37:07,409
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1064
01:37:09,954 --> 01:37:10,955
This guy...

1065
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:12,540
we put him on.

1066
01:37:12,665 --> 01:37:14,291
Says he knows McCauley.

1067
01:37:20,047 --> 01:37:21,048
Who are you?

1068
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,425
Waingro.

1069
01:37:24,009 --> 01:37:25,636
My name's Waingro.

1070
01:37:26,011 --> 01:37:29,181
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1071
01:37:30,608 --> 01:37:33,068
We took some major scores together.

1072
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:38,907
Why haven't I heard from him?

1073
01:37:39,032 --> 01:37:40,909
He's probably busy right now.

1074
01:37:41,535 --> 01:37:43,161
But he's real thorough.

1075
01:37:44,538 --> 01:37:46,665
He ain't going to forget about you.

1076
01:37:46,999 --> 01:37:48,375
That's reassuring.

1077
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:52,671
I got some moves I could make here.

1078
01:37:53,797 --> 01:37:56,008
Probably be a big help to you.

1079
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:19,196
You recognize the grill man?

1080
01:38:26,662 --> 01:38:27,705
No.

1081
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:28,873
Folsom.

1082
01:38:28,998 --> 01:38:31,334
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1083
01:38:33,002 --> 01:38:34,462
I ain't got my break yet.

1084
01:38:34,587 --> 01:38:36,756
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1085
01:38:37,006 --> 01:38:39,633
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1086
01:38:39,966 --> 01:38:41,676
Take your break later.

1087
01:38:42,052 --> 01:38:43,470
Piece of shit.

1088
01:38:43,887 --> 01:38:45,013
Pick up!

1089
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:49,768
Where the hell is he?

1090
01:38:49,893 --> 01:38:52,103
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1091
01:38:52,312 --> 01:38:53,396
So did I.

1092
01:39:01,363 --> 01:39:02,405
Hang on.

1093
01:39:05,408 --> 01:39:10,172
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1094
01:39:21,976 --> 01:39:23,143
Where are you?

1095
01:39:23,269 --> 01:39:25,980
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1096
01:39:26,981 --> 01:39:28,315
I can't dump them.

1097
01:39:31,068 --> 01:39:32,861
They know you see them?

1098
01:39:33,153 --> 01:39:35,030
They're doing parallels.

1099
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:39,285
I can try to dump them again.

1100
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:41,370
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

1101
01:39:41,495 --> 01:39:43,121
If not, you'll draw them to us.

1102
01:39:43,705 --> 01:39:44,789
Go to Ventura.

1103
01:39:44,914 --> 01:39:46,165
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

1104
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:49,752
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

1105
01:40:16,362 --> 01:40:17,405
Pick up.

1106
01:40:19,908 --> 01:40:21,409
Neil, man. What's up?

1107
01:40:21,618 --> 01:40:22,660
What's up?

1108
01:40:22,785 --> 01:40:24,495
What are you doing here?

1109
01:40:24,787 --> 01:40:28,249
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1110
01:40:28,374 --> 01:40:29,667
Right now, today.

1111
01:40:30,043 --> 01:40:31,336
You remember the drill?

1112
01:40:31,461 --> 01:40:32,712
Yeah, sure.

1113
01:40:32,921 --> 01:40:34,047
You cool?

1114
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:36,424
You know I'm cool.

1115
01:40:37,217 --> 01:40:39,594
One answer: Yes or no. Right now.

1116
01:40:53,824 --> 01:40:56,619
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1117
01:40:57,995 --> 01:40:59,538
Out back in five.

1118
01:41:10,007 --> 01:41:11,384
What's burning?

1119
01:41:11,926 --> 01:41:13,135
What is this?

1120
01:41:13,636 --> 01:41:15,638
Where do you think you're going?

1121
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:53,993
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1122
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:55,202
Hands up!

1123
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,995
Put them up! Now!

1124
01:42:58,372 --> 01:42:59,456
Get on your knees!

1125
01:42:59,623 --> 01:43:00,624
The keys!

1126
01:43:01,625 --> 01:43:03,085
Get on your knees!

1127
01:43:07,464 --> 01:43:08,590
Get over there!

1128
01:43:10,008 --> 01:43:11,093
Turn around!

1129
01:43:11,301 --> 01:43:12,844
Put your hands behind you!

1130
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:14,012
Get down!

1131
01:43:14,137 --> 01:43:15,180
Stay down!

1132
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:17,224
Get down!

1133
01:43:20,018 --> 01:43:22,437
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1134
01:43:27,317 --> 01:43:28,360
Stay down!

1135
01:43:29,152 --> 01:43:32,155
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1136
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:35,284
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1137
01:43:35,409 --> 01:43:36,577
Think of your families.

1138
01:43:36,702 --> 01:43:39,162
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1139
01:43:39,538 --> 01:43:44,251
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1140
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:46,920
anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1141
01:43:48,338 --> 01:43:49,339
The key.

1142
01:43:49,548 --> 01:43:50,799
What key?

1143
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:54,803
Sit down and stay down!

1144
01:43:55,846 --> 01:43:58,473
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1145
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,741
Get down. Down, down, down.

1146
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:51,451
Put your heads down!

1147
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:19,353
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1148
01:45:19,478 --> 01:45:22,690
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1149
01:45:25,859 --> 01:45:28,821
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1150
01:45:46,297 --> 01:45:48,591
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1151
01:45:48,716 --> 01:45:51,769
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1152
01:46:30,014 --> 01:46:31,766
They're already coming out.

1153
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:34,393
We gotta take them in the car.

1154
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:36,354
Wait till they are all in.

1155
01:46:36,604 --> 01:46:38,898
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1156
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:49,825
Police! Move!

1157
01:46:51,285 --> 01:46:52,662
Move. Move. Get down.

1158
01:47:14,808 --> 01:47:16,142
Move it. Down, down.

1159
01:47:19,646 --> 01:47:20,814
We did it!

1160
01:47:25,318 --> 01:47:26,361
Move!

1161
01:47:32,668 --> 01:47:33,877
Get down!

1162
01:47:43,429 --> 01:47:44,471
Get in the car!

1163
01:48:01,238 --> 01:48:02,448
Go! Go!

1164
01:49:03,347 --> 01:49:04,390
Go!

1165
01:49:29,298 --> 01:49:30,299
Go!

1166
01:51:11,407 --> 01:51:12,408
Come on!

1167
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,733
Get down!

1168
01:51:59,871 --> 01:52:03,791
All the way down! Get down! Now!

1169
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:05,236
Come here.

1170
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:52,073
I got you.

1171
01:53:56,411 --> 01:54:00,790
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

1172
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:04,169
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.</i>

1173
01:54:04,419 --> 01:54:08,381
<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1174
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:12,311
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers...</i>

1175
01:54:12,436 --> 01:54:13,854
Excuse me, bartender.

1176
01:54:14,063 --> 01:54:17,900
<i>Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1177
01:54:18,025 --> 01:54:21,152
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...</i>

1178
01:54:21,361 --> 01:54:23,780
<i>that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1179
01:54:24,072 --> 01:54:25,490
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

1180
01:54:25,615 --> 01:54:29,661
<i>one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

1181
01:54:29,786 --> 01:54:31,037
<i>Also fatally wounded:</i>

1182
01:54:31,162 --> 01:54:34,457
<i>Another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...</i>

1183
01:54:34,582 --> 01:54:38,169
<i>during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.</i>

1184
01:54:40,296 --> 01:54:41,756
All right, hold him.

1185
01:54:42,090 --> 01:54:43,590
It's all right.

1186
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:52,683
So?

1187
01:54:52,808 --> 01:54:54,810
He's got blood loss and shock.

1188
01:54:54,935 --> 01:54:58,689
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1189
01:54:59,564 --> 01:55:00,691
Bottom line?

1190
01:55:01,233 --> 01:55:03,944
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1191
01:55:04,403 --> 01:55:06,780
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1192
01:55:07,489 --> 01:55:08,573
Six, seven hours.

1193
01:55:08,699 --> 01:55:10,242
- That's it?
- That's it.

1194
01:55:10,659 --> 01:55:12,119
Take off your shirt.

1195
01:55:12,244 --> 01:55:13,245
What?

1196
01:55:14,746 --> 01:55:16,206
Take off your shirt.

1197
01:55:24,715 --> 01:55:26,091
My daughter gave it to me.

1198
01:55:26,216 --> 01:55:28,385
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1199
01:55:40,772 --> 01:55:41,940
Listen to me.

1200
01:55:42,357 --> 01:55:46,320
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1201
01:55:47,695 --> 01:55:48,779
Where's Charlene?

1202
01:55:48,904 --> 01:55:53,293
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1203
01:55:53,418 --> 01:55:55,420
I'm not going without her.

1204
01:55:55,795 --> 01:55:57,088
Think about that.

1205
01:55:57,422 --> 01:55:59,215
I will meet you at Nate's.

1206
01:55:59,466 --> 01:56:00,759
Where are you going?

1207
01:56:00,925 --> 01:56:04,679
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1208
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:06,431
Who did it?

1209
01:56:07,807 --> 01:56:09,100
Who wasn't there?

1210
01:56:10,602 --> 01:56:11,603
Trejo.

1211
01:56:15,482 --> 01:56:17,025
See you at Nate's.

1212
01:56:25,367 --> 01:56:26,743
You still want me?

1213
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:30,288
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

1214
01:56:31,539 --> 01:56:32,666
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

1215
01:56:33,124 --> 01:56:35,085
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1216
01:56:36,419 --> 01:56:37,462
All right.

1217
01:56:39,506 --> 01:56:41,299
Goddamn you, Chris.

1218
01:56:41,424 --> 01:56:42,550
Goddamn you.

1219
01:56:43,551 --> 01:56:45,762
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1220
01:56:46,012 --> 01:56:47,055
Right.

1221
01:57:35,403 --> 01:57:37,530
Why did you do it? What happened?

1222
01:57:38,906 --> 01:57:40,450
- They made me.
- Who?

1223
01:57:40,616 --> 01:57:41,826
Where's Anna?

1224
01:57:43,244 --> 01:57:44,370
She's dead.

1225
01:57:47,332 --> 01:57:50,418
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1226
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:52,086
Who did it?

1227
01:57:52,253 --> 01:57:53,254
Who did it?

1228
01:57:53,379 --> 01:57:55,089
They had Anna, man.

1229
01:57:55,256 --> 01:57:56,257
Who?

1230
01:57:57,674 --> 01:57:58,800
Waingro.

1231
01:57:59,593 --> 01:58:00,802
Waingro.

1232
01:58:01,595 --> 01:58:02,721
On his own?

1233
01:58:04,765 --> 01:58:06,475
- For someone.
- Who?

1234
01:58:07,768 --> 01:58:10,062
The other he worked for.

1235
01:58:11,271 --> 01:58:12,481
Van Zant.

1236
01:58:15,484 --> 01:58:16,777
Van Zant?

1237
01:58:21,072 --> 01:58:22,239
Are you sure?

1238
01:58:22,823 --> 01:58:24,075
Van Zant.

1239
01:58:25,868 --> 01:58:28,204
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1240
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:30,790
I don't think so.

1241
01:58:31,499 --> 01:58:32,667
Come on.

1242
01:58:34,543 --> 01:58:36,087
I don't remember.

1243
01:58:41,509 --> 01:58:42,635
I'll call a medic.

1244
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,595
I'm not going to make it.

1245
01:58:46,889 --> 01:58:48,975
I can't feel nothing.

1246
01:58:51,227 --> 01:58:53,104
My Anna's gone.

1247
01:58:55,314 --> 01:58:56,941
She's gone.

1248
01:58:58,985 --> 01:59:00,944
Don't leave me like this.

1249
01:59:01,987 --> 01:59:03,488
Please, homes.

1250
01:59:04,614 --> 01:59:06,574
Don't leave me like this.

1251
01:59:33,527 --> 01:59:35,988
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1252
01:59:36,905 --> 01:59:38,157
It's a new one.

1253
01:59:39,616 --> 01:59:42,077
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1254
01:59:42,453 --> 01:59:43,829
10725.

1255
01:59:44,204 --> 01:59:45,581
<i>10725.</i>

1256
01:59:45,914 --> 01:59:46,999
<i>Chris?</i>

1257
01:59:47,499 --> 01:59:49,209
He's with me, my place.

1258
01:59:49,543 --> 01:59:51,879
Next, Waingro, okay?

1259
01:59:53,714 --> 01:59:55,007
You got the time?

1260
01:59:56,008 --> 01:59:57,384
I'll make time.

1261
01:59:57,760 --> 01:59:59,511
And I need a new out.

1262
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:01,347
Is it blown?

1263
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,767
How can I trust it?

1264
02:00:07,894 --> 02:00:09,020
You got it.

1265
02:00:10,063 --> 02:00:11,522
Stay healthy.

1266
02:00:17,070 --> 02:00:18,696
Charlene Shiherlis.

1267
02:00:19,614 --> 02:00:22,533
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1268
02:00:22,659 --> 02:00:24,160
Neil's transportation.

1269
02:00:24,285 --> 02:00:28,122
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1270
02:00:28,581 --> 02:00:30,958
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1271
02:00:31,084 --> 02:00:32,669
Sure. Now he needs another.

1272
02:00:32,794 --> 02:00:34,921
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1273
02:00:36,589 --> 02:00:39,050
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1274
02:00:39,175 --> 02:00:42,720
He's a C.I. For a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1275
02:00:42,929 --> 02:00:44,514
On Neil McCauley.

1276
02:00:44,722 --> 02:00:46,182
How much time we got?

1277
02:00:46,641 --> 02:00:51,279
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1278
02:01:44,999 --> 02:01:47,752
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1279
02:01:48,002 --> 02:01:49,295
Who told you?

1280
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:51,964
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1281
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:53,382
Who?

1282
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:39,519
Waingro, where is he?

1283
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:41,688
Where?

1284
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:43,106
How would I know?

1285
02:03:08,881 --> 02:03:09,882
Well...

1286
02:03:10,466 --> 02:03:12,218
what do we have here?

1287
02:03:13,177 --> 02:03:14,345
This pretty?

1288
02:03:14,470 --> 02:03:15,555
This pretty?

1289
02:03:19,182 --> 02:03:20,642
You piece of shit.

1290
02:03:20,767 --> 02:03:23,770
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1291
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:25,647
You want out? This is out.

1292
02:03:25,772 --> 02:03:28,984
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1293
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:30,944
How'd I get into this?

1294
02:03:31,069 --> 02:03:32,112
Easy.

1295
02:03:32,904 --> 02:03:35,240
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1296
02:03:35,615 --> 02:03:36,742
Fix her a drink.

1297
02:03:36,867 --> 02:03:38,702
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1298
02:03:38,827 --> 02:03:39,870
Fuck her.

1299
02:03:42,289 --> 02:03:44,916
You better get in there and stay in there.

1300
02:03:48,503 --> 02:03:49,880
Lookie here.

1301
02:03:51,423 --> 02:03:54,134
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1302
02:03:54,259 --> 02:03:56,053
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

1303
02:03:56,178 --> 02:03:57,929
He stays with me.

1304
02:04:08,065 --> 02:04:09,442
So, what now?

1305
02:04:12,286 --> 02:04:13,371
He's right.

1306
02:04:13,496 --> 02:04:15,498
You want out? This is out.

1307
02:04:17,375 --> 02:04:19,585
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1308
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:20,920
No shit.

1309
02:04:21,504 --> 02:04:23,880
That's right. You would have to.

1310
02:04:24,506 --> 02:04:28,343
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1311
02:04:29,344 --> 02:04:32,806
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1312
02:04:32,931 --> 02:04:37,644
'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1313
02:04:37,769 --> 02:04:39,646
juvenile facilities.

1314
02:04:39,896 --> 02:04:41,648
Then he steals a car.

1315
02:04:42,357 --> 02:04:47,237
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1316
02:04:47,862 --> 02:04:50,115
Fucked for life.

1317
02:04:51,324 --> 02:04:53,994
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1318
02:04:55,662 --> 02:04:59,960
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1319
02:05:01,966 --> 02:05:04,677
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1320
02:05:05,678 --> 02:05:07,013
You can do it...

1321
02:05:07,388 --> 02:05:09,640
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1322
02:05:13,686 --> 02:05:15,021
What else are you selling?

1323
02:05:15,146 --> 02:05:16,522
All kinds of shit.

1324
02:05:18,024 --> 02:05:22,820
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1325
02:05:29,576 --> 02:05:31,119
<i>Here's an update.</i>

1326
02:05:31,244 --> 02:05:32,787
Drucker's on Line 2.

1327
02:05:32,912 --> 02:05:34,414
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

1328
02:05:37,292 --> 02:05:39,210
Drucker's on the other line.

1329
02:05:39,878 --> 02:05:41,087
Conference him in.

1330
02:05:42,339 --> 02:05:43,381
Go ahead.

1331
02:05:43,757 --> 02:05:45,383
Vincent, it's me.

1332
02:05:48,094 --> 02:05:50,230
One answer. What's it going to be?

1333
02:05:57,237 --> 02:05:59,740
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1334
02:05:59,865 --> 02:06:02,951
That's good. Here's the deal.

1335
02:06:03,369 --> 02:06:06,497
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1336
02:06:06,622 --> 02:06:09,083
and become a born-again good citizen.

1337
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:13,629
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1338
02:06:14,046 --> 02:06:18,842
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1339
02:06:18,967 --> 02:06:20,219
<i>Van Zant.</i>

1340
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:23,930
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1341
02:06:24,055 --> 02:06:26,182
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1342
02:06:26,766 --> 02:06:30,019
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.</i>

1343
02:06:30,269 --> 02:06:33,772
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1344
02:06:33,897 --> 02:06:35,774
under the name Jamieson.

1345
02:06:36,024 --> 02:06:40,570
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1346
02:06:40,696 --> 02:06:43,657
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in County.</i>

1347
02:06:43,782 --> 02:06:48,120
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1348
02:06:48,245 --> 02:06:50,706
<i>and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.</i>

1349
02:06:50,831 --> 02:06:53,208
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1350
02:06:53,500 --> 02:06:54,793
How're you feeling?

1351
02:06:55,585 --> 02:06:57,129
Banged up, but I'll live.

1352
02:07:06,346 --> 02:07:07,681
He's here.

1353
02:07:08,432 --> 02:07:10,058
Neil is still here.

1354
02:07:11,268 --> 02:07:12,728
I can feel it.

1355
02:07:13,603 --> 02:07:15,022
For how long?

1356
02:07:16,565 --> 02:07:18,483
Seven, eight hours, max.

1357
02:07:27,909 --> 02:07:29,202
What did you do?

1358
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,838
That was you?

1359
02:07:31,213 --> 02:07:33,090
I don't sell metal.

1360
02:07:33,799 --> 02:07:36,843
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1361
02:07:36,968 --> 02:07:38,511
We gotta go together.

1362
02:07:39,012 --> 02:07:41,348
Those other people were with you?

1363
02:07:42,891 --> 02:07:44,476
My friend, Michael...

1364
02:07:46,227 --> 02:07:48,146
he knew the risks.

1365
02:07:52,692 --> 02:07:54,694
When it rains, you get wet.

1366
02:07:57,530 --> 02:07:59,074
Get packed. Let's go.

1367
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:20,470
Why did you do this to me?

1368
02:08:32,065 --> 02:08:33,400
It'll be all right.

1369
02:08:33,525 --> 02:08:35,443
Do you understand?

1370
02:08:40,115 --> 02:08:41,865
It's going to be all right.

1371
02:08:53,335 --> 02:08:56,463
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1372
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,220
Here's some cash.

1373
02:09:06,223 --> 02:09:07,474
When is it over?

1374
02:09:10,945 --> 02:09:12,613
Twenty-two hours from now.

1375
02:09:12,989 --> 02:09:16,951
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1376
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:21,581
Go now.

1377
02:09:21,706 --> 02:09:23,666
You want out? There's the door.

1378
02:09:24,292 --> 02:09:26,252
Will you let me leave later?

1379
02:09:31,424 --> 02:09:32,967
It will be different.

1380
02:09:34,635 --> 02:09:36,346
Do you even understand?

1381
02:10:07,334 --> 02:10:08,668
It's ready.

1382
02:10:16,385 --> 02:10:18,178
This is my friend Ralph.

1383
02:10:18,845 --> 02:10:20,806
You didn't tell me you were...

1384
02:10:21,682 --> 02:10:23,016
Oh, my God!

1385
02:10:23,225 --> 02:10:24,434
Where's Lauren?

1386
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:26,560
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1387
02:10:27,061 --> 02:10:29,188
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1388
02:10:29,313 --> 02:10:30,398
What for?

1389
02:10:30,523 --> 02:10:31,649
Sit down.

1390
02:10:32,650 --> 02:10:34,026
Don't you get angry?

1391
02:10:34,902 --> 02:10:35,986
I'm angry.

1392
02:10:37,738 --> 02:10:39,573
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1393
02:10:40,324 --> 02:10:43,244
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1394
02:10:44,829 --> 02:10:48,207
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1395
02:10:49,332 --> 02:10:51,176
In her ex-husband's...

1396
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:54,930
dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1397
02:10:55,055 --> 02:10:56,432
if you want to.

1398
02:10:59,143 --> 02:11:01,353
But you do not get to watch...

1399
02:11:01,687 --> 02:11:03,522
my fucking...

1400
02:11:03,647 --> 02:11:04,815
television set!

1401
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:06,275
For God's sake.

1402
02:11:13,157 --> 02:11:14,950
Put the television set down.

1403
02:11:15,117 --> 02:11:17,661
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1404
02:11:17,786 --> 02:11:19,872
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

1405
02:11:20,039 --> 02:11:23,208
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1406
02:11:23,333 --> 02:11:24,960
Our situation is absurd.

1407
02:11:27,588 --> 02:11:30,382
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1408
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:37,139
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1409
02:11:37,347 --> 02:11:39,933
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1410
02:11:40,059 --> 02:11:41,268
How admirable.

1411
02:11:41,393 --> 02:11:43,645
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

1412
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:45,314
No.

1413
02:11:46,774 --> 02:11:49,735
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1414
02:11:50,569 --> 02:11:52,654
you walk through our life dead.

1415
02:11:53,405 --> 02:11:57,450
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1416
02:12:10,505 --> 02:12:12,882
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1417
02:12:13,424 --> 02:12:14,634
The plane...

1418
02:12:15,093 --> 02:12:18,554
charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1419
02:12:18,679 --> 02:12:20,306
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1420
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:24,727
Touches down...

1421
02:12:24,852 --> 02:12:27,355
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1422
02:12:27,605 --> 02:12:31,159
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1423
02:12:33,036 --> 02:12:34,121
Where's Chris?

1424
02:12:34,454 --> 02:12:35,497
He's gone.

1425
02:12:36,873 --> 02:12:37,874
What?

1426
02:12:38,542 --> 02:12:41,044
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1427
02:12:41,169 --> 02:12:43,422
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

1428
02:12:44,297 --> 02:12:45,340
What happened?

1429
02:12:46,466 --> 02:12:48,009
It's a free country.

1430
02:12:53,265 --> 02:12:55,058
Check in with me at 9:00...

1431
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:57,102
everything is still cool.

1432
02:12:58,978 --> 02:13:00,104
All right.

1433
02:13:23,294 --> 02:13:25,755
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1434
02:13:29,091 --> 02:13:30,885
I know life is short.

1435
02:13:31,552 --> 02:13:33,596
Whatever time you get is luck.

1436
02:13:36,348 --> 02:13:37,892
You want to walk?

1437
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,521
You walk right now...

1438
02:13:44,148 --> 02:13:45,733
all on your own.

1439
02:13:46,442 --> 02:13:49,070
On your own you choose to come with me.

1440
02:13:55,493 --> 02:13:57,078
All I know is...

1441
02:13:59,372 --> 02:14:02,999
there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1442
02:14:04,209 --> 02:14:06,169
if it's going to be alone...

1443
02:14:07,253 --> 02:14:08,755
without you.

1444
02:15:08,822 --> 02:15:09,906
I got a live one.

1445
02:15:10,866 --> 02:15:12,242
I'll hold.

1446
02:15:14,703 --> 02:15:16,163
Show yourself.

1447
02:15:17,289 --> 02:15:19,332
- Do it.
- Shut up!

1448
02:15:23,211 --> 02:15:25,422
Now, just one second at the window...

1449
02:15:26,715 --> 02:15:28,467
and it's all over.

1450
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:19,543
Hey, man...

1451
02:17:21,336 --> 02:17:24,590
you know any place to rent around here?

1452
02:17:27,968 --> 02:17:30,104
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1453
02:17:42,283 --> 02:17:43,409
It's not him.

1454
02:17:43,534 --> 02:17:44,869
It's not Chris.

1455
02:17:53,044 --> 02:17:54,712
Unit 2, this is Command.

1456
02:17:55,213 --> 02:17:56,589
Take him at the street.

1457
02:17:56,714 --> 02:17:57,882
Check him out.

1458
02:18:25,534 --> 02:18:26,952
He's John Peterson.

1459
02:18:27,077 --> 02:18:29,036
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

1460
02:18:29,161 --> 02:18:31,580
<i>Bukowski, Gene.</i>

1461
02:18:31,914 --> 02:18:33,124
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

1462
02:18:33,249 --> 02:18:34,500
<i>It's clean.</i>

1463
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:38,629
Let him go.

1464
02:18:39,088 --> 02:18:40,172
Roger.

1465
02:18:40,464 --> 02:18:42,425
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1466
02:18:44,802 --> 02:18:45,886
It's no-go.

1467
02:18:55,688 --> 02:18:58,482
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1468
02:18:58,607 --> 02:19:00,317
Yeah, that would be nice.

1469
02:19:31,482 --> 02:19:32,816
What do you got?

1470
02:19:32,941 --> 02:19:34,359
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1471
02:19:47,623 --> 02:19:49,083
Hello, it's Vincent.

1472
02:19:49,708 --> 02:19:50,751
<i>What do you got?</i>

1473
02:19:50,876 --> 02:19:53,295
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1474
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:54,755
<i>That's it.</i>

1475
02:20:03,555 --> 02:20:04,848
You know what?

1476
02:20:07,434 --> 02:20:08,852
Neil is gone.

1477
02:20:13,982 --> 02:20:15,526
Flying like a bird.

1478
02:20:16,443 --> 02:20:17,736
How do you know?

1479
02:20:19,321 --> 02:20:20,531
We still got bait!

1480
02:20:20,656 --> 02:20:22,699
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

1481
02:20:22,825 --> 02:20:24,118
What do we got?

1482
02:20:25,035 --> 02:20:26,995
<i>Bon voyage, motherfucker.</i>

1483
02:20:28,497 --> 02:20:29,956
You were good.

1484
02:20:31,791 --> 02:20:33,418
I'm going to the hotel.

1485
02:20:34,710 --> 02:20:36,671
I'm going to take a shower...

1486
02:20:37,714 --> 02:20:40,550
and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1487
02:22:51,452 --> 02:22:52,494
Here.

1488
02:22:59,626 --> 02:23:00,669
Come on.

1489
02:23:09,344 --> 02:23:10,387
Shit.

1490
02:23:19,688 --> 02:23:21,398
Motherfucking waste.

1491
02:23:24,902 --> 02:23:27,863
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1492
02:23:27,988 --> 02:23:29,031
Not you, baby.

1493
02:23:29,156 --> 02:23:30,365
Not you.

1494
02:23:35,704 --> 02:23:38,665
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1495
02:23:38,791 --> 02:23:41,585
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1496
02:23:48,966 --> 02:23:51,052
I need somebody to help...

1497
02:23:57,225 --> 02:23:58,309
I got you.

1498
02:23:59,644 --> 02:24:02,730
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1499
02:24:03,272 --> 02:24:04,774
Let's get a doctor!

1500
02:24:04,899 --> 02:24:06,609
Let's go! A doctor here!

1501
02:24:06,943 --> 02:24:09,320
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

1502
02:24:09,447 --> 02:24:11,581
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

1503
02:24:14,126 --> 02:24:16,586
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1504
02:24:17,003 --> 02:24:20,465
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1505
02:24:20,841 --> 02:24:22,008
Her pressure's down.

1506
02:24:22,134 --> 02:24:24,344
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1507
02:24:24,469 --> 02:24:25,679
It's ready.

1508
02:24:27,347 --> 02:24:29,349
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1509
02:24:29,474 --> 02:24:30,475
I don't know.

1510
02:24:30,600 --> 02:24:31,935
Where did you find her?

1511
02:24:32,144 --> 02:24:33,270
The bathtub.

1512
02:24:35,272 --> 02:24:37,524
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1513
02:24:37,649 --> 02:24:39,067
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1514
02:24:39,192 --> 02:24:42,529
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1515
02:24:44,489 --> 02:24:47,950
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1516
02:24:48,075 --> 02:24:51,036
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1517
02:24:57,376 --> 02:25:00,463
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1518
02:25:00,588 --> 02:25:02,047
Her vital signs are stable.

1519
02:25:02,214 --> 02:25:04,717
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1520
02:25:04,842 --> 02:25:05,926
She's okay?

1521
02:25:06,051 --> 02:25:07,136
She's doing good.

1522
02:25:07,261 --> 02:25:08,763
She'll be okay.

1523
02:25:09,263 --> 02:25:11,140
She's going to be okay.

1524
02:25:11,348 --> 02:25:14,226
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1525
02:25:15,686 --> 02:25:18,773
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1526
02:25:23,194 --> 02:25:25,821
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1527
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,365
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1528
02:25:28,491 --> 02:25:31,243
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1529
02:25:46,217 --> 02:25:47,301
It's me.

1530
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:50,522
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1531
02:25:51,188 --> 02:25:53,065
I still can't find a driver...

1532
02:25:53,232 --> 02:25:54,900
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1533
02:25:55,317 --> 02:25:56,693
<i>One other thing...</i>

1534
02:25:57,736 --> 02:25:59,613
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

1535
02:26:00,072 --> 02:26:04,159
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1536
02:26:04,451 --> 02:26:06,203
<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

1537
02:26:06,495 --> 02:26:07,871
You figured right.

1538
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,873
So, so long, brother.

1539
02:26:12,126 --> 02:26:13,585
You take it easy.

1540
02:26:14,294 --> 02:26:15,587
You're home free.

1541
02:26:17,673 --> 02:26:18,882
Take it easy.

1542
02:26:29,935 --> 02:26:31,018
What is it?

1543
02:26:31,352 --> 02:26:32,520
Nothing.

1544
02:26:32,854 --> 02:26:34,063
Home free.

1545
02:27:12,267 --> 02:27:14,144
I gotta take care of something.

1546
02:27:14,311 --> 02:27:15,562
Is there time?

1547
02:27:16,271 --> 02:27:17,439
There's time.

1548
02:27:46,227 --> 02:27:48,854
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1549
02:28:31,229 --> 02:28:32,230
<i>Registration.</i>

1550
02:28:32,355 --> 02:28:33,440
This is room service.

1551
02:28:33,565 --> 02:28:37,444
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1552
02:28:37,569 --> 02:28:39,362
<i>- They're always doing that.
- I know.</i>

1553
02:28:39,487 --> 02:28:41,030
<i>1735.</i>

1554
02:28:41,156 --> 02:28:42,365
Thank you.

1555
02:30:26,101 --> 02:30:27,769
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1556
02:30:27,894 --> 02:30:30,939
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1557
02:30:31,523 --> 02:30:32,940
<i>Do not panic.</i>

1558
02:30:33,065 --> 02:30:35,067
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

1559
02:30:40,114 --> 02:30:41,532
I'm staying here.

1560
02:30:41,657 --> 02:30:44,952
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1561
02:30:49,543 --> 02:30:51,843
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1562
02:30:52,927 --> 02:30:55,138
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1563
02:30:57,223 --> 02:30:58,850
And she chose you.

1564
02:31:01,478 --> 02:31:03,271
She picked your place.

1565
02:31:05,482 --> 02:31:07,358
It's not right, what happened to her.

1566
02:31:07,484 --> 02:31:08,943
No, it's not.

1567
02:31:25,417 --> 02:31:27,127
Is there any way that...

1568
02:31:29,505 --> 02:31:31,548
it could work out between us?

1569
02:31:34,384 --> 02:31:36,720
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1570
02:31:37,095 --> 02:31:38,138
But...

1571
02:31:38,347 --> 02:31:39,890
in the end...

1572
02:31:44,853 --> 02:31:46,563
It's like you said:

1573
02:31:49,733 --> 02:31:51,068
All I am...

1574
02:31:51,777 --> 02:31:53,862
is what I'm going after.

1575
02:32:01,286 --> 02:32:03,455
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1576
02:32:14,591 --> 02:32:16,510
Go on, if you have to.

1577
02:32:19,303 --> 02:32:20,429
I'll stay.

1578
02:32:20,555 --> 02:32:22,598
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1579
02:32:25,643 --> 02:32:27,103
Just be careful.

1580
02:32:27,895 --> 02:32:30,532
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1581
02:32:31,658 --> 02:32:32,659
Okay?

1582
02:33:33,469 --> 02:33:35,805
Security. There's a fire on three.

1583
02:33:35,930 --> 02:33:37,556
We have to evacuate all floors.

1584
02:33:37,681 --> 02:33:39,308
I can't leave here.

1585
02:33:48,192 --> 02:33:51,195
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1586
02:34:05,501 --> 02:34:06,794
He's here on 17.

1587
02:34:09,802 --> 02:34:11,015
Look at me.

1588
02:34:11,182 --> 02:34:12,225
Look at me!

1589
02:34:15,603 --> 02:34:16,646
Look at me!

1590
02:34:48,634 --> 02:34:50,011
LAPD! Don't move!

1591
02:34:50,136 --> 02:34:51,929
Put your hands on your head!

1592
02:35:27,507 --> 02:35:29,342
Switch me to TAC 5.

1593
02:35:29,967 --> 02:35:31,176
Casals...

1594
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:32,552
JJ...

1595
02:35:33,303 --> 02:35:34,596
Drucker, JJ...

1596
02:35:34,721 --> 02:35:37,057
<i>I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

1597
02:35:37,182 --> 02:35:38,266
What have you got?

1598
02:35:38,391 --> 02:35:41,186
<i>Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th floor.</i>
